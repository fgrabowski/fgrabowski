15 years old developer interested in new technologies, cybersecurity also interested in music and mixing. Addicted to coding. 
Currently attending to High School.

So far I've worked with Java creating some stuff using Spring Boot. Learning Internet Security. Spending my freetime on reading about new tech, listening to music and creating software, sometimes even doing games in C# (Unity) just for fun. Also planning to do some crazy stuff together with my friends from hackerspace soon..

I'm into creating Web Applications, I find that they're our future :)

I'm fluent in Java and familiar with JavaScript,Python.

When I was 13 I wrote my first code line although I took a break for 2 years from programming, I lost my passion and it wasn't enjoyable any more. When I went to new school I got a lot of freetime and since then I'm back and I learn a lot in IT field and this is my big passion which I really enjoy to do.
