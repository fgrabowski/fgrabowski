Hi, I am Filip and I am 16 years old high school student interested in technology.
Music lover that never leaves home without headphones.


Ever since I joined to HackerSpace Trojmiasto I gained experience with microcontrollers and IoT. 
Some of my projects are build on top of ESP32 or Raspberry Pico. 
And I am still learning low-end development tech stack, meant by Rust, Python.
Also I needed to do Frontend on my web applications, ReactJS.


Now I am learning Rust, Python and TypeScript.
However before every project I choose language that fits the best and learn it. 

Current Projects: Hackerspace Lucien (Python, Raspberry Pico) - Book finder, we used Led Stripes to navigate through shelf and show the book on it. PyExplorers (Py, MongoDB, FastAPI) - Guitar checker, user can type guitar serial number and get information about it. 

Key Values: 🙌 Simplicity, 🦾 Innovative, 🤝 Helpfulness

My dream is to automate public transport and therefore this is my biggest project which combines my passions (Technology & Transport).
In the future I will be software engineer, and I love it.

> In my freetime I also attend to many Technology Events.
