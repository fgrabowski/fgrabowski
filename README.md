Hi, I am Filip and I am 16 years old high school student interested in technology.

Ever since I joined to HackerSpace Trojmiasto I gained experience with microcontrollers and IoT. 
Some of my projects are build on ESP32 or Raspberry Pico. 
And I am still learning low-end development tech stack, meant by Rust, Python.
Also I needed to do FrontEnd on my web applications, ReactJS.

Now I am learning Rust, Python and TypeScript.
However before every project I choose language that fits the best and learn it. 

--- 

My dream is to automate public transport and therefore this is my biggest project which combines my passions (Technology & Transport).
In the future I will be software engineer, and I love it.

> In my freetime I also attend to many Technology Events.
