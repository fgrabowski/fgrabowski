Hello, my name is Filip and I am high school student with a deep interest in technology.
Music lover that never leaves home without headphones.

Since the end of 2022 I have been continuously developing my skills as a software engineer. So far I have used Python and Java or Rust across my personal projects. Everyday I am learning something new and I hope that in the future I will take a part in creating the technology of the future. 

Fluent in Python, learning Rust, also used Java previously.
However, before starting project, I choose language that fits the best and learn it if needed.

In april 2023 I started my internship as a DevOps Engineer at Soundoshi. It combines my two passions (Music & Programming) and the technology of the future (Blockchain). Learn more about Soundoshi [here](https://soundoshi.com/). 

> In my freetime I also attend to many Technology Events.
